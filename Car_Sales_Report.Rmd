# 1. Introduction/Overview

## 1.1. Project Overview
This project aims to explore, clean, and analyze a dataset of used car sales in the UK.
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle:  [100,000 UK Used Car Data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes/data), contains information about 100,000 used cars from various makes including Audi, BMW, Ford, Hyundai, Mercedes, Skoda, Toyota, Vauxhall, and Volkswagen.

The primary goal of this project is to build and evaluate predictive models that can effectively predict car sales.
This involves several steps, starting with initial data exploration to understand the structure and characteristics of the data. 
This is followed by data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data. 
Feature engineering is then performed to create new variables that can improve the performance of the predictive models.
The data is then split into training and testing sets, and various machine learning models are built and evaluated using cross-validation.
The performance of each model is assessed using appropriate metrics, and the best model is selected based on these metrics.
This report documents the entire process, providing a detailed overview of the steps taken and the results obtained.
It serves as a comprehensive guide to the project, offering insights into the data and the predictive models built.
# 2. Data Exploration

This section is dedicated to exploring the dataset, which is a critical step in understanding the data we're working with.
We will only be using the data files regarding the makes of the cars and not the cclass or focus datasets as they are in their respective make datasets.
```{r load dataset, include = FALSE}
audi <- read_csv("data/audi.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
bmw <- read_csv("data/bmw.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)
ford <- read_csv("data/ford.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
hyundi <- read_csv("data/hyundi.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
merc <- read_csv("data/merc.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)
skoda <- read_csv("data/skoda.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)
toyota <- read_csv("data/toyota.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)
vauxhall <- read_csv("data/vauxhall.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)
vw <- read_csv("data/vw.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)
```

We first check if all the datasets have the same columns and column names. 
```{r check differences, echo=FALSE}
data_frames <- list(audi, bmw, ford, hyundi, merc, skoda, toyota, vauxhall, vw)

first_column_names <- names(data_frames[[1]])

for (i in seq_along(data_frames)) {
  current_column_names <- names(data_frames[[i]])
  
  if (!all(current_column_names %in% first_column_names)) {    
    print(setdiff(current_column_names, first_column_names))
  }
}

rm(data_frames, first_column_names, current_column_names, i)
```

As we see one of them has a different column name, we will change it to match the others so we don't get two columns that shpuld actually be the same when we join the datasets.

```{r rename, echo=FALSE}
hyundi <- rename(hyundi, tax = `tax(£)`)
```

Before combining the datasets, we will add a column to each dataset to identify the make of the car as this might be beneficial for the model performance.

```{r add makes, echo=FALSE}	
audi$make <- "Audi"
bmw$make <- "BMW"
ford$make <- "Ford"
hyundi$make <- "Hyundai"
merc$make <- "Mercedes"
skoda$make <- "Skoda"
toyota$make <- "Toyota"
vauxhall$make <- "Vauxhall"
vw$make <- "Volkswagen"
```

Now we can combine all the datasets into one.
```{r join data, echo=FALSE}
# Combine all the datasets into one
all_cars <- bind_rows(list(audi, bmw, ford, hyundi, merc, skoda, toyota, vauxhall, vw))

# delete the individual datasets to free up memory
rm(audi, bmw, ford, hyundi, merc, skoda, toyota, vauxhall, vw)
```

## 2.1. Data Overview

The dataset contains `r nrow(all_cars)` rows and `r ncol(all_cars)` columns.
Here we can look at the first few rows of the dataset.

```{r head, echo=FALSE}
kable(head(all_cars), align = 'l')
```

Here is a brief description of each variable in the dataset.

```{r structure of dataset, echo=FALSE}
variables_description <- data.frame(
  `Data Type` = sapply(all_cars, function(col) class(col)[1]),
  Description = c(
    "Model of the car",
    "Year of manufacture",
    "Price of the car",
    "Type of transmission",
    "Mileage of the car",
    "Type of fuel used",
    "Tax on the car",
    "Miles per gallon",
    "Engine size",
    "Make of the car"
  ),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

kable(variables_description, format = "markdown", col.names = c("Data Type", "Description"), align = 'l')

rm(variables_description)
```
## 2.2. Data Cleaning

In this section, we will clean our dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types if necessary.
There are `r sum(is.na(all_cars))` missing values, and `r sum(duplicated(all_cars))` duplicate rows so we need to adress these issues.
We will remove the duplicate rows that might have appeared during the data gathering process.

```{r remove duplicates, echo=FALSE}
all_cars <- all_cars[!duplicated(all_cars), ]
```
Next, we convert some of the variables into factors, namely:  model, make, transmission and fuelType.
```{r factors, echo=FALSE}
all_cars <- mutate(all_cars, model = as.factor(model), transmission = as.factor(transmission), fuelType = as.factor(fuelType), make = as.factor(make))
```
We are now ready to move on to the next step in the data analysis process.

## 2.3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Lets try to understand the underlying structure of the data, identify outliers and anomalies, discover patterns, spot relationships among variables and test assumptions. 

### 2.3.1. Univariate Analysis
We can start by looking at the distribution of the categorical variables.

There are `r length(unique(all_cars$'make'))` unique car makes and `r length(unique(all_cars$'model'))` unique models in the dataset.
There are `r length(unique(all_cars$'transmission'))` types of transmission: `r unique(all_cars$'transmission')` and  `r length(unique(all_cars$'fuelType'))` types of fuel: `r unique(all_cars$'fuelType')`.

Here we can inspect them visually.
```{r bar plots, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, ffig.width=5}
all_cars %>%
  select(where(is.factor)) %>% 
  gather(variable, value) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=value), width=0.7, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") + 
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales="free", ncol = 2) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  ggtitle("Bar plots of categorical variables")
```

For the numerical variables we will plot histograms and boxplots to visualize the distribution of the data and identify any outliers.

```{r bar plots numerical, echo=FALSE, fig.height=10, ffig.width=5}
numeric_data <- all_cars %>% select(where(is.numeric))

plot_hist_box <- function(data, variable) {
  histogram <- ggplot(data, aes_string(variable)) + 
    geom_histogram(fill = "skyblue", color = "black", bins = 30) +
    ggtitle(paste("Histogram of", variable))
  
  boxplot <- ggplot(data, aes_string(variable)) + 
    geom_boxplot(horizontal = TRUE, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
    ggtitle(paste("Boxplot of", variable))
  
  plot <- gridExtra::arrangeGrob(boxplot, histogram, ncol = 1)
  
  return(plot)
}

plots <- lapply(names(numeric_data), plot_hist_box, data = numeric_data)

do.call(grid.arrange, c(plots, ncol = 2))

rm(numeric_data, plots)
```

Here is a table that summarizes some of the attributes of the numerical variables.

```{r numerical table, echo=FALSE}
calc_mode <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
}

descriptive_stats <- select_if(all_cars, is.numeric) %>%
  map_df(function(x) tibble(
    Mean = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median = median(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    Mode = calc_mode(x),
    SD = sd(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    Min = min(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    Max = max(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    Skewness = skewness(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    Kurtosis = kurtosis(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  ), .id = "Variable")

kable(descriptive_stats)
rm(descriptive_stats, calc_mode)
```

We see there are some outliers so we will adress each variable individually and clean the data.

```{r clean data, echo=FALSE}
all_cars_clean <- all_cars
```

#### Year

There is at least one clear error in the year since one car is from the future `r max(all_cars_clean$year)`, so we will remove entries whose year is greater than 2024 and also the outliers with years below 1990.
```{r year plot, echo=FALSE}
all_cars_clean <- all_cars_clean %>% filter(year <= 2024 & year >= 1990)
plot <- lapply("year", plot_hist_box, data = all_cars_clean)
do.call(grid.arrange, c(plot, ncol = 1))
rm(plot)
```
We removerd `r nrow(filter(all_cars, year > 2024 & year < 1990))` rows from the dataset.

#### Mileage

In regards to mileage the mean is `r mean(all_cars$'mileage')`, which is affected by the presence of an outlier value of `r max(all_cars$'mileage')` miles. 
We will therefore remove these outliers (greater than 150000) to get a more accurate representation of the data.

```{r mileage, echo=FALSE}
all_cars_clean <- all_cars_clean %>% filter(mileage < 150000)
plot <- lapply("mileage", plot_hist_box, data = all_cars_clean)
do.call(grid.arrange, c(plot, ncol = 1))
rm(plot)
```

We removerd `r nrow(filter(all_cars, mileage >= 150000))` rows from the dataset.

#### Miles per Gallon (MPG)

Besides the clear outlier with mpg of `r max(all_cars$'mpg')`, the distribution of the mpg is quite skewed to the right. 
We will remove the outliers with mpg greater than 100 and lower than 15.
```{r mpg, echo=FALSE}
all_cars_clean <- all_cars_clean %>% filter(mpg < 100 & mpg > 15)
plot <- lapply("mpg", plot_hist_box, data = all_cars_clean)
do.call(grid.arrange, c(plot, ncol = 1))
rm(plot)
```

We removerd `r nrow(filter(all_cars, mpg >= 100 & mpg <= 15))` rows from the dataset.

#### Tax

It looks there are two outlier clusters: tax values over 350 and lower than 100.
Lets plot the distributions of the observations from the high tax value group.

```{r tax high, echo=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=6}
all_cars_high_tax <- all_cars_clean %>% filter(tax > 350) %>% select(where(is.numeric))

plots <- lapply(names(all_cars_high_tax), plot_hist_box, data = all_cars_high_tax)
do.call(grid.arrange, c(plots, ncol = 2))
rm(plots)
```
It looks like that these cars also have quite high values for enginesize and price, with most values above the average (most likely luxury cars). 
We will remove these `r nrow(all_cars_high_tax)` outliers.

```{r tax remove high, echo=FALSE}	
all_cars_clean <- all_cars_clean %>% filter(tax < 350)
rm (all_cars_high_tax)
```

Now looking at the low tax value group.

```{r tax low, echo=FALSE, fig.height=7, ffig.width=6}
all_cars_low_tax <- all_cars_clean %>% filter(tax < 100) %>% select(where(is.numeric))
nrow(all_cars_low_tax)
plots <- lapply(names(all_cars_low_tax), plot_hist_box, data = all_cars_low_tax)
do.call(grid.arrange, c(plots, ncol = 2))
rm(plots)
```
First of all we see there is quite a large number of cars in this cluster: `r nrow(all_cars_low_tax)`.
Excluding a clear outlier, these cars have a small price and the other values are not particularly different from others besides the low value of tax.

Therefore we will keep these and only remove the outlier with a price of `r max(all_cars_low_tax$price)` for a relatively low tax.

```{r tax remove low, echo=FALSE}	
all_cars_clean <- all_cars_clean %>% filter(!(tax < 100 & price > 50000))
rm (all_cars_low_tax)
```

#### Engine Size

The Histogram shows us that there are some cars with a reported engine sizze of 0, which is not possible so we will remove them.

```{r engineSize 0, echo=FALSE}
all_cars_clean <- all_cars_clean %>% filter(engineSize > 0)
plot <- lapply("engineSize", plot_hist_box, data = all_cars_clean)
do.call(grid.arrange, c(plot, ncol = 1))
rm(plot)
```

Now looking at the bigger engine sizes we see that there are a small number of cars with engine sizes above 4.

```{r engineSize big, echo=FALSE, fig.height=7, ffig.width=6}
all_cars_clean_big_engine <- all_cars_clean %>% filter(engineSize > 4)%>% select(where(is.numeric))

plots <- lapply(names(all_cars_clean_big_engine), plot_hist_box, data = all_cars_clean_big_engine)
do.call(grid.arrange, c(plots, ncol = 2))
rm(plots, all_cars_clean_big_engine)
```

As we can see all of these cars have a high tax, but  most of them are around 150 tax, the rest are outliers with a very high tax, so we eill remove just these.

```{r ngineSize remove big, echo=FALSE}
all_cars_clean <- all_cars_clean %>% filter(!(engineSize > 4 & tax > 200))
plot <- lapply("engineSize", plot_hist_box, data = all_cars_clean)
do.call(grid.arrange, c(plot, ncol = 1))
rm(plot)
```

#### Price

The distribution, like the mileage is a long tail distribution, which we could try to normalize with a log distribution to improve model performnce but will leave as is for now.

#### After Outlier Removal

We ended up removing `r nrow(all_cars) - nrow(all_cars_clean)` rows from the dataset.

```{r after outlier, echo=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=6}
numeric_data <- all_cars_clean %>% select(where(is.numeric))

plots <- lapply(names(numeric_data), plot_hist_box, data = numeric_data)

do.call(grid.arrange, c(plots, ncol = 2))

rm(numeric_data, plots)
```

### 2.3.2. Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis
We can also look at the relationships between variables and see how they affect each other.

```{r ggpair,echo=FALSE}
plot <- all_cars_clean %>% select(where(is.numeric)) %>% ggpairs()

ggsave("ggpairs.png", plot, width = 10, height = 10)
knitr::include_graphics("ggpairs.png")
rm(plot)
```

```{r corrplot,echo=FALSE}
options(repr.plot.width=10, repr.plot.height=8)
corrplot(all_cars_clean %>% select(where(is.numeric)) %>% 
cor(), method="color", addCoef.col = "black")
```

From the heatmap, we can say the following about the price:
- There is a moderate positive correlation (0.5) between the price and the year. This means that cars with a higher year tend to be more expensive.
- There is a moderate negative correlation (-0.42) between the price and the mileage. This means that cars with higher mileage tend to be cheaper.
- There is a small positive correlation (0.31) between the price and the tax. This means that cars with higher tax tend to be more expensive.
- There is a moderate negative correlation (-0.47) between the price and the miles per gallon. This means that cars with higher mpg tend to be cheaper.
- There is a significant positive correlation (0.66) between the price and the engine size. This means that cars with higher engine size tend to be more expensive.

In regards to other relations between variables:
- There is a significant negative correlation (-0.74) between the mileage and the year. This means that cars with a lower (older) year tend to have more mileage.
- There is a significant negative correlation (-0.6) between the miles per gallon and the tax. This means that cars with high mpg tend to have lower tax.

We should investigate Multivariate outliers for the features with high correlations:
- price-year
- price-mileage
- price-mpg
- price-enginesize
- tax-mpg
- mileage-year


```{r scatter plots,echo=FALSE}
plot1 <- ggplot(all_cars_clean, aes(x = year, y = price, color = fuelType)) + geom_point()
plot2 <- ggplot(all_cars_clean, aes(x = mileage, y = price)) + geom_point()
plot3 <- ggplot(all_cars_clean, aes(x = mpg, y = price, color = fuelType)) + geom_point()
plot4 <- ggplot(all_cars_clean, aes(x = engineSize, y = price, color = transmission)) + geom_point()
plot5 <- ggplot(all_cars_clean, aes(x = mpg, y = tax)) + geom_point()
plot6 <- ggplot(all_cars_clean, aes(x = year, y = mileage)) + geom_point()

grid <- gridExtra::arrangeGrob(plot1, plot2, plot3, plot4, plot5, plot6, ncol = 2)

ggsave("scatter_plots.png", grid, width = 10, height = 10)

knitr::include_graphics("scatter_plots.png")

rm(plot1, plot2, plot3, plot4, plot5, plot6, grid)
```

There don't seem to be many outliers left, so we will only remove the two outliers that have a mpg of 60 or higher but a tax of about 250.

```{r remove outlier tax-mpg,echo=FALSE}
all_cars_clean <- all_cars_clean %>% filter(!(mpg >= 55 & tax > 200))
```

We have removed `r nrow(all_cars) - nrow(all_cars_clean)` outliers from the dataset which represent `r round((nrow(all_cars) - nrow(all_cars_clean)) / nrow(all_cars) * 100, 2)`% of the original data.

We can now look at the relationships between the categorical variables and the price of the cars.

```{r scatter categoricals,echo=FALSE, fig.height=5}

plot1 <- all_cars_clean %>% select(make, price, transmission) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_boxplot(aes(x=make, y=price, color=transmission)) + 
  ggtitle("Price per make per transmission")

plot2 <- all_cars_clean %>% select(fuelType, make, price) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_boxplot(aes(x=make, y=price, color=fuelType)) + 
  ggtitle("Price per make per fuelType")

grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, ncol = 1)

rm(plot1, plot2)
```


## 2.4. Feature Engineering & Data Preparation

First we'll start by encoding the categorical variables into numerical values so that they can be used in the models.

```{r ,echo=FALSE}
all_cars_clean_encoded <- all_cars_clean
list_categorical <- c("model", "transmission", "fuelType", "make")

all_cars_clean_encoded[list_categorical] <- lapply(all_cars_clean_encoded[list_categorical], function(x) as.numeric(factor(x)))

kable(head(all_cars_clean_encoded), align = 'l')
rm(list_categorical)
```

As mentioned before we will try to perform a log transformation to normalize the values of mileage and price to improve performance in models that assume normality.

```{r log transformation mileage, echo=FALSE}
all_cars_clean_encoded_log_mileage <- all_cars_clean_encoded %>% 
  mutate(mileage = log(mileage))

plot <- lapply("mileage", plot_hist_box, data = all_cars_clean_encoded_log_mileage)

do.call(grid.arrange, c(plot, ncol = 1))
rm(plot, all_cars_clean_encoded_log_mileage)
```

Clearly the log transformation has not improved the distribution of the mileage variable. We will keep it as it was.

```{r log transformation price, echo=FALSE}
qqplot_price_before <- ggplot(all_cars_clean_encoded, aes(sample = price)) + 
  stat_qq() + 
  stat_qq_line() +
  ggtitle("Q-Q Plot of Price (Before Transformation)")

all_cars_clean_encoded <- all_cars_clean_encoded %>% 
  mutate(price = log(price))

plot <- lapply("price", plot_hist_box, data = all_cars_clean_encoded)

do.call(grid.arrange, c(plot, ncol = 1))
rm(plot)
```

```{r log transformation price qqplot, echo=FALSE}
qqplot_price_after <- ggplot(all_cars_clean_encoded, aes(sample = log(price))) + 
  stat_qq() + 
  stat_qq_line() +
  ggtitle("Q-Q Plot of Price (After Transformation)")


grid <- gridExtra::arrangeGrob(qqplot_price_before, qqplot_price_after, ncol = 2)

ggsave("qq_plots.png", grid, width = 10, height = 10)

knitr::include_graphics("qq_plots.png")

rm(qqplot_price_before, qqplot_price_after, grid)
rm(plot_hist_box)
```

For the price variable, the log transformation has improved the distribution and made it more normal. We will keep this transformation.

We are now ready to start building the price prediction models.

## 2.5. Modeling Approaches

We will be building several models to predict the price of the cars and evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as RMSE, R2 and MAE and select the best model based on these metrics.

- RMSE: Root Mean Squared Error is the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.
- R2: R-squared is a measure of how well the model fits the data. It is a value between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit.
- MAE: Mean Absolute Error is the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values.

# 3. Model Building
We will start by splitting the data into training and testing sets and then build and evaluate the models, starting with a baseline linear regression model and then moving on to more complex models such as Elastic Net and LightGBM.

```{r setup evaluate, echo=FALSE}

results <- data.frame(
  Model = character(),
  RMSE = numeric(),
  R2 = numeric()
)

evaluate_model <- function(predictions, model_name, results) {
  predictions_original_scale <- exp(predictions)
  actual_values_original_scale <- exp(testData$price)

  metrics <- postResample(pred = predictions_original_scale, obs = actual_values_original_scale)

  results <- rbind(results, data.frame(
    Model = model_name,
    RMSE = metrics['RMSE'],
    R2 = metrics['Rsquared'],
    MAE = metrics['MAE']
  ))
  kable(results)
}

```

## 3.1. Data Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets.
We will split the data into training and testing sets using an 80/20 split.
```{r split data,echo=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(all_cars_clean_encoded$price, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)

trainData <- all_cars_clean_encoded[trainIndex, ]
trainData_X <- trainData %>% select(-price)
trainData_Y <- trainData$price

testData <- all_cars_clean_encoded[-trainIndex, ]
testData_X <- testData %>% select(-price)
testData_Y <- testData$price

rm(trainIndex)
```

## 3.2. Model 1: Baseline linear regression model
Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used statistical techniques for predictive modeling.
It aims to model the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y (price) and one or more independent variables (features of the cars) denoted X. 
The relationship is modeled through a linear function and the unknown model parameters are estimated from the data.
This is generally done by minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed responses in the dataset and those predicted by the linear approximation.

Linear regression benefits from being straightforward to understand and interpret, and it's particularly useful when there is a linear relationship between the inputs and the output.
However, it's often too simplistic to capture complex patterns in data unless transformations or interactions are included.

```{r baseline lr model, echo=FALSE}
train_control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)

lr_model <- train(
  price ~ .,
  data = trainData,
  method = "lm",
  trControl = train_control
)

print(lr_model$bestTune)

predictions_lr <- predict(lr_model, newdata = testData)

evaluate_model(predictions_lr, "Baseline Linear Regression", results)

rm(lr_model, train_control)
```

## 3.3. Model 2: Elastic Net Model

The Elastic Net is a regularized regression method that linearly combines the L1 and L2 penalties of the Lasso and Ridge methods.
The model solves a regularized version of the least squares, where the objective function is augmented by adding penalty terms that constrain the size of the coefficients:
- L1 penalty (Lasso): Encourages sparsity which can be useful for feature selection if some features are irrelevant.
- L2 penalty (Ridge): Shrinks the coefficients of correlated predictors towards each other, thus stabilizing the solution.
Elastic Net is particularly useful when there are multiple features that are correlated with each other. 
The combination of L1 and L2 penalty functions allows Elastic Net to inherit some of Ridge's stability under correlated data and Lasso's ability to select sparse features.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
train_control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)

tuneGrid <- expand.grid(
  alpha = seq(0, 1, by = 0.1), # mix of L1 and L2 regularization
  lambda = 10^seq(-3, 3, length.out = 10) # regularization strength
)

elasticnet_model <- train(
  price ~ ., 
  data = trainData, 
  method = "glmnet", 
  trControl = train_control, 
  tuneGrid = tuneGrid
)

predictions_elasticnet  <- predict(elasticnet_model, newdata = testData)

evaluate_model(predictions_elasticnet, "Elastic Net", results)

rm(elasticnet_model, train_control, tuneGrid)
```

However, the Elastic Net model did not improve on the performance of the baseline linear regression model.
We will now try a more complex model, the LightGBM model, to see if it can provide better predictions.

## 3.4. Model 3: LightGBM Model

LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) is an efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting framework by Microsoft.
It uses tree-based learning algorithms designed for speed and performance.
LightGBM extends the gradient boosting model by introducing two key innovations:
- Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS): A technique to filter out the data instances to find a split value, focusing more on those instances that produce larger gradients.
- Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB): A method to reduce the number of features by combining mutually exclusive features, thus significantly decreasing the number of data dimensions without sacrificing much accuracy.
LightGBM constructs trees leaf-wise (best-first), rather than level-wise like other boosting methods. 
This makes the model more efficient and generally leads to better model fit as it grows the tree more with the most promising regions.

```{r LightGmb Model, echo=FALSE}
dtrain <- lgb.Dataset(data = as.matrix(trainData_X), label = trainData_Y)

# Set up the parameters for LightGBM
params <- list(
  objective = "regression",
  metric = "rmse",
  learning_rate = 0.01,
  num_leaves = 31,
  max_depth = -1,
  min_data_in_leaf = 20,
  bagging_fraction = 1,
  feature_fraction = 1
)

# Perform cross-validation to find the optimal number of iterations
cv_result <- lgb.cv(
  params = params,
  data = dtrain,
  nrounds = 2000,
  nfold = 5,
  early_stopping_rounds = 10
)

# Train the LightGBM model
lightgbm_model <- lgb.train(
  params = params,
  data = dtrain,
  nrounds = cv_result$best_iter
)

predictions_lightgbm <- predict(lightgbm_model, newdata = as.matrix(testData_X))

evaluate_model(predictions_lightgbm, "LightGBM", results)

rm(dtrain, cv_result, lightgbm_model)
```

As we can see this is quite a good result. We will now compare the results of the three models.
